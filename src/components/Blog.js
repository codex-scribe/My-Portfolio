      <p>I am about to graduate from my coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech.  I have learned a lot in this course, and I feel a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
      <p>It seems like only yesterday when we sat down for our first class on Zoom, and our instructor began introducing HTML.  I had learned HTML before, but on the third day in class we began learning CSS, and after that everything was new.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it seemed like the class would never let up.  We learned so much so fast, that I felt I wasn't getting anything.  But every now and then I would look back and see how far I had come.  A homework assignment from only two weeks ago looked simple now, elementary.  Each project was bigger than the one before.</p>
